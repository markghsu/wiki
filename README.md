#Wiki Project for Udacity Web Development Class

This is the final project for the Udacity Web Development class [CS253](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs253).
It uses Python and GoogleAppEngine to create a wiki page where users can log in and edit pages.

## Accessing the site
This site can be found at http://markswiki-1183.appspot.com/
You can also install [GoogleAppEngine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python), navigate to the directory of the project, and run 
	'dev_appserver.py helloworld/'
You can then find the site at localhost:8080

##Future todos
This site still needs to be styled and have more front-end functionality. I plan to use Backbone and Jquery to handle basic styling/functionality, most likely with bootstrap CSS.
